I say \\n\\nhalf-hearted because I'm still application-centric, and I don't go as far with \\n\\nkeyboard shortcuts as I could. But I don't use the desktop at all (never have, \\n\\non any system), and I don't use ctrl alt keyboard shortcuts because I \\n\\npersonally find them awkward (YMMV). If you must use Windows, the first step \\n\\ntowards a productive system is managing your Start menu. \\n\\n\\n\\nI use the main level of the Start menu with numbered shortcuts to my most \\n\\ncommon programs. \\\"0 Control Panel[3]\\\", \\\"1 Mozilla[4]\\\", \\\"2 Emacs[5]\\\", \\\"3 DOS \\n\\nhome\\\", \\\"4 DOS work\\\", \\\"5 DOS incoming\\\" (each of which gives me a command line, \\n\\nbut in different directories), \\\"7 Python[6]\\\", \\\"9 IE\\\". Also \\\"# Explorer home\\\", \\n\\n\\\"$ Explorer work\\\", \\\"% Explorer incoming\\\", which open Explorer windows in \\n\\nvarious useful directories (the same directories as the DOS shortcuts, only \\n\\nwith the shift key held down, and yes, I intentionally set it up so that $ went \\n\\nto my work folder). Less-used programs are taken out of their useless submenus \\n\\n(as installed) and moved directly into the Programs submenu and given unique \\n\\nfirst letters as needed. \\\"Ad-aware[7]\\\", \\\"Excel[8]\\\", \\\"IM\\\", \\\"Netscape 4[9]\\\", \\n\\n\\\"Paint Shop Pro\\\", \\\"Query Tool (ODBC)[10]\\\", \\\"VMWare[11]\\\", \\\"Word[12]\\\". All other \\n\\nsubmenus except Startup are removed from the Programs menu. (Yes, delete \\n\\n\\\"Accessories\\\". Do you honestly ever use it? If so, it's probably a sign of a \\n\\nlarger productivity problem.) Things which never need to be run manually (like \\n\\nWinZip and Quicktime) are removed from the Programs menu. Maintaining a clean \\n\\nPrograms menu is an ongoing struggle, but well worth it. \\n\\n\\n\\nOn most modern keyboards, there is a key next to your left alt key that opens \\n\\nthe start menu, which you can press with your left thumb without taking your \\n\\nfingers off the home keys. Otherwise ctrl esc always works. Menu 4 gives me a \\n\\nnew command prompt in my work directory. Menu P N runs Netscape 4 (for \\n\\ncompatibility testing in my day job, ugh). Mozilla and Emacs are almost always \\n\\nopen, but I quit lesser-used applications as soon as I'm done using them \\n\\n(mostly because my laptop doesn't have a lot of memory). \\n\\n\\n\\nI install Cygwin[13] so that the command line is actually useful. Cygwin is a \\n\\ncollection of Windows ports of all your favorite UNIX utilities, including mv, \\n\\ncp, scp, ssh, man, tar, less, grep, patch, ncftp, cvs, and many others. And \\n\\nbash, which I don't use because I dislike how it handles Windows pathnames. I \\n\\nalso set the properties of my command line shortcuts to set the window size to \\n\\n120 x 50 (almost full screen at 1024 x 768), and screen buffer size to 120 x \\n\\n3000. Set window position at 0 x 0, and don't let the system position the \\n\\nwindow. \\n\\n\\n\\nIn Mozilla, I set my home page to \\\"about:blank\\\", set Internet Search to search \\n\\nwith Google, use Tabbed Browsing, open tabs instead of windows in all possible \\n\\ncases, always show the tab bar, and load links in the background (essential for \\n\\nweblog surfing, you can ctrl click links to open them in new tabs in the \\n\\nbackground). Under Scripts & Plugins, I do not allow scripts to open \\n\\nunrequested windows. I turn off the sidebar, turn on the Site Navigation Bar, \\n\\ndelete all pre-installed bookmarks, and create two bookmarks: one which takes \\n\\nme to my webmail, and another which takes me to my internal site search[14], \\n\\nfrom which I can find all other bookmarks I need. \\n\\n\\n\\nIn Internet Explorer, I set my home page to the page to edit my weblog, since \\n\\nthat's the only thing I do in Internet Explorer. alt tab back and forth between \\n\\nMozilla and IE is easier than ctrl pgup/pgdown between tabs within Mozilla, \\n\\nsince TEXTAREAs in Mozilla lose focus when you switch tabs, making copying and \\n\\npasting weblog entries virtually impossible. \\n\\n\\n\\nI use Emacs locally and vi remotely, because the default behavior of Emacs is \\n\\nso heinous as to render it unusable. (For instance, editing a CGI script named \\n\\nfoo.cgi on a web server with Emacs would generate a foo.cgi~ backup file, which \\n\\nis world-readable and is sent as plain text to any browser that asks. Try this \\n\\nsometime on your favorite web site.) Among other things, my .emacs file (which \\n\\nis actually called _emacs on Windows) instructs Emacs to store all backup files \\n\\nin a single directory (d:\\\\backup); to treat all XML files as DocBook, all CGI \\n\\nscripts as Python, and all SQL scripts as PL/SQL; to use Cygwin's bash shell \\n\\nfor M-x-shell; to use a single maximized frame with no menubar, titled as the \\n\\nname of the current file; to show column numbers; to accept \\\"y\\\" and \\\"n\\\" for \\n\\nyes/no questions; not to blink; not to beep; and to close the current file when \\n\\nI press M-w. I use some weird registry hacks and a hacked notepad.exe to get \\n\\nall text files to open in Emacs. (I got this idea from Ultraedit[15].) My \\n\\n_emacs file is my second most backed-up possession. \\n\\n\\n\\nI don't use Windows' useless directory structure for user home directories. On \\n\\nmy D drive I have d:\\\\home (contains directories for my books and other personal \\n\\nprojects, each under CVS control&#8212;also set as my home directory using the \\n\\nHOME environment variable), d:\\\\work (contains directories for each work \\n\\nproject, also under CVS), d:\\\\incoming (set as default download directory for \\n\\nall programs that download things), and d:\\\\backup (used by Emacs, and for \\n\\ntemporary storage, for instance for storing originals when checking out newly \\n\\ncreated CVS projects). I don't know or care what's where on my C drive. \\n\\n\\n\\nI have tried many, many address books, and still store all my contacts, email \\n\\naddresses, snail mail addresses, phone numbers, and other vital personal \\n\\ninformation in a text file called phone, stored in d:\\\\home\\\\phone. It is not in \\n\\nany particular format, other than being plain text and usually including blank \\n\\nlines between entries. I categorize people with simple keywords in parentheses \\n\\nafter their name, and use M-x-occur in Emacs to search by keyword. This file is \\n\\nmy single most backed-up possession. \\n\\n\\n\\nOther essential free Windows utilities I use (in no particular order): TweakUI\\n\\n[16], Cygwin[17], Guidescope[18], ZoneAlarm[19].\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[1]  http://bitworking.org/Oct2002.html#X631695997519494480\\n\\n[2]  http://www.winterspeak.com/columns/082001.html\\n\\n[3]  http://www.annoyances.org/exec/show/article02-013\\n\\n[4]  http://www.mozilla.org/\\n\\n[5]  http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/ntemacs.html\\n\\n[6]  http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePython/\\n\\n[7]  http://www.lavasoftusa.com/\\n\\n[8]  http://www.openoffice.org/\\n\\n[9]  http://sillydog.org/narchive/\\n\\n[10] http://gpoulose.home.att.net/\\n\\n[11] http://www.vmware.com/\\n\\n[12] http://www.openoffice.org/\\n\\n[13] http://www.cygwin.com/\\n\\n[14] http://diveintomark.org/mt/mt-search.cgi\\n\\n[15] http://www.ultraedit.com/downloads/index.html#notepad\\n\\n     Replacing Notepad with Ultraedit-32\\n\\n[16] http://www.microsoft.com/ntworkstation/downloads/PowerToys/Networking/NTTweakUI.asp\\n\\n[17] http://www.cygwin.com/\\n\\n[18] http://www.guidescope.com/\\n\\n[19] http://download.com.com/3000-2092-10039884.html?part=zonealarm&subj=dlpage\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n          \"Apologies all.

I say \\n\\nhalf-hearted because I'm still application-centric, and I don't go as far with \\n\\nkeyboard shortcuts as I could. But I don't use the desktop at all (never have, \\n\\non any system), and I don't use ctrl alt keyboard shortcuts because I \\n\\npersonally find them awkward (YMMV). If you must use Windows, the first step \\n\\ntowards a productive system is managing your Start menu. \\n\\n\\n\\nI use the main level of the Start menu with numbered shortcuts to my most \\n\\ncommon programs. \\\"0 Control Panel[3]\\\", \\\"1 Mozilla[4]\\\", \\\"2 Emacs[5]\\\", \\\"3 DOS \\n\\nhome\\\", \\\"4 DOS work\\\", \\\"5 DOS incoming\\\" (each of which gives me a command line, \\n\\nbut in different directories), \\\"7 Python[6]\\\", \\\"9 IE\\\". Also \\\"# Explorer home\\\", \\n\\n\\\"$ Explorer work\\\", \\\"% Explorer incoming\\\", which open Explorer windows in \\n\\nvarious useful directories (the same directories as the DOS shortcuts, only \\n\\nwith the shift key held down, and yes, I intentionally set it up so that $ went \\n\\nto my work folder). Less-used programs are taken out of their useless submenus \\n\\n(as installed) and moved directly into the Programs submenu and given unique \\n\\nfirst letters as needed. \\\"Ad-aware[7]\\\", \\\"Excel[8]\\\", \\\"IM\\\", \\\"Netscape 4[9]\\\", \\n\\n\\\"Paint Shop Pro\\\", \\\"Query Tool (ODBC)[10]\\\", \\\"VMWare[11]\\\", \\\"Word[12]\\\". All other \\n\\nsubmenus except Startup are removed from the Programs menu. (Yes, delete \\n\\n\\\"Accessories\\\". Do you honestly ever use it? If so, it's probably a sign of a \\n\\nlarger productivity problem.) Things which never need to be run manually (like \\n\\nWinZip and Quicktime) are removed from the Programs menu. Maintaining a clean \\n\\nPrograms menu is an ongoing struggle, but well worth it. \\n\\n\\n\\nOn most modern keyboards, there is a key next to your left alt key that opens \\n\\nthe start menu, which you can press with your left thumb without taking your \\n\\nfingers off the home keys. Otherwise ctrl esc always works. Menu 4 gives me a \\n\\nnew command prompt in my work directory. Menu P N runs Netscape 4 (for \\n\\ncompatibility testing in my day job, ugh). Mozilla and Emacs are almost always \\n\\nopen, but I quit lesser-used applications as soon as I'm done using them \\n\\n(mostly because my laptop doesn't have a lot of memory). \\n\\n\\n\\nI install Cygwin[13] so that the command line is actually useful. Cygwin is a \\n\\ncollection of Windows ports of all your favorite UNIX utilities, including mv, \\n\\ncp, scp, ssh, man, tar, less, grep, patch, ncftp, cvs, and many others. And \\n\\nbash, which I don't use because I dislike how it handles Windows pathnames. I \\n\\nalso set the properties of my command line shortcuts to set the window size to \\n\\n120 x 50 (almost full screen at 1024 x 768), and screen buffer size to 120 x \\n\\n3000. Set window position at 0 x 0, and don't let the system position the \\n\\nwindow. \\n\\n\\n\\nIn Mozilla, I set my home page to \\\"about:blank\\\", set Internet Search to search \\n\\nwith Google, use Tabbed Browsing, open tabs instead of windows in all possible \\n\\ncases, always show the tab bar, and load links in the background (essential for \\n\\nweblog surfing, you can ctrl click links to open them in new tabs in the \\n\\nbackground). Under Scripts & Plugins, I do not allow scripts to open \\n\\nunrequested windows. I turn off the sidebar, turn on the Site Navigation Bar, \\n\\ndelete all pre-installed bookmarks, and create two bookmarks: one which takes \\n\\nme to my webmail, and another which takes me to my internal site search[14], \\n\\nfrom which I can find all other bookmarks I need. \\n\\n\\n\\nIn Internet Explorer, I set my home page to the page to edit my weblog, since \\n\\nthat's the only thing I do in Internet Explorer. alt tab back and forth between \\n\\nMozilla and IE is easier than ctrl pgup/pgdown between tabs within Mozilla, \\n\\nsince TEXTAREAs in Mozilla lose focus when you switch tabs, making copying and \\n\\npasting weblog entries virtually impossible. \\n\\n\\n\\nI use Emacs locally and vi remotely, because the default behavior of Emacs is \\n\\nso heinous as to render it unusable. (For instance, editing a CGI script named \\n\\nfoo.cgi on a web server with Emacs would generate a foo.cgi~ backup file, which \\n\\nis world-readable and is sent as plain text to any browser that asks. Try this \\n\\nsometime on your favorite web site.) Among other things, my .emacs file (which \\n\\nis actually called _emacs on Windows) instructs Emacs to store all backup files \\n\\nin a single directory (d:\\\\backup); to treat all XML files as DocBook, all CGI \\n\\nscripts as Python, and all SQL scripts as PL/SQL; to use Cygwin's bash shell \\n\\nfor M-x-shell; to use a single maximized frame with no menubar, titled as the \\n\\nname of the current file; to show column numbers; to accept \\\"y\\\" and \\\"n\\\" for \\n\\nyes/no questions; not to blink; not to beep; and to close the current file when \\n\\nI press M-w. I use some weird registry hacks and a hacked notepad.exe to get \\n\\nall text files to open in Emacs. (I got this idea from Ultraedit[15].) My \\n\\n_emacs file is my second most backed-up possession. \\n\\n\\n\\nI don't use Windows' useless directory structure for user home directories. On \\n\\nmy D drive I have d:\\\\home (contains directories for my books and other personal \\n\\nprojects, each under CVS control&#8212;also set as my home directory using the \\n\\nHOME environment variable), d:\\\\work (contains directories for each work \\n\\nproject, also under CVS), d:\\\\incoming (set as default download directory for \\n\\nall programs that download things), and d:\\\\backup (used by Emacs, and for \\n\\ntemporary storage, for instance for storing originals when checking out newly \\n\\ncreated CVS projects). I don't know or care what's where on my C drive. \\n\\n\\n\\nI have tried many, many address books, and still store all my contacts, email \\n\\naddresses, snail mail addresses, phone numbers, and other vital personal \\n\\ninformation in a text file called phone, stored in d:\\\\home\\\\phone. It is not in \\n\\nany particular format, other than being plain text and usually including blank \\n\\nlines between entries. I categorize people with simple keywords in parentheses \\n\\nafter their name, and use M-x-occur in Emacs to search by keyword. This file is \\n\\nmy single most backed-up possession. \\n\\n\\n\\nOther essential free Windows utilities I use (in no particular order): TweakUI\\n\\n[16], Cygwin[17], Guidescope[18], ZoneAlarm[19].\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[1]  http://bitworking.org/Oct2002.html#X631695997519494480\\n\\n[2]  http://www.winterspeak.com/columns/082001.html\\n\\n[3]  http://www.annoyances.org/exec/show/article02-013\\n\\n[4]  http://www.mozilla.org/\\n\\n[5]  http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/ntemacs.html\\n\\n[6]  http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePython/\\n\\n[7]  http://www.lavasoftusa.com/\\n\\n[8]  http://www.openoffice.org/\\n\\n[9]  http://sillydog.org/narchive/\\n\\n[10] http://gpoulose.home.att.net/\\n\\n[11] http://www.vmware.com/\\n\\n[12] http://www.openoffice.org/\\n\\n[13] http://www.cygwin.com/\\n\\n[14] http://diveintomark.org/mt/mt-search.cgi\\n\\n[15] http://www.ultraedit.com/downloads/index.html#notepad\\n\\n     Replacing Notepad with Ultraedit-32\\n\\n[16] http://www.microsoft.com/ntworkstation/downloads/PowerToys/Networking/NTTweakUI.asp\\n\\n[17] http://www.cygwin.com/\\n\\n[18] http://www.guidescope.com/\\n\\n[19] http://download.com.com/3000-2092-10039884.html?part=zonealarm&subj=dlpage\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n          \"Apologies all.

And, I think that:\\n\\n\\n\\nLooks like a case of \\\"MY experience is comprehensive, YOUR'S is\\n\\nanecdotal, THEY don't know what they're talking about\\\".\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n>1.  The people who pay the wages don't give a flyin' heck what programming\\n\\n>language you write things in... they just want it to work.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn my experience, they do care.  It has to work certainly, and in\\n\\nparticular it has to work with what they've already got, and it has to\\n\\nwork on client's systems.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy limited experience of Java started a few years ago when support on\\n\\nLinux was so terrible that I ran away screaming and haven't come back yet.\\n\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft has announced that they plan to remove Java from Windows.\\n\\nThey took it out of XP already and it has to be installed with a\\n\\nservice pack.  Somehow, I can't imagine them removing the ability to\\n\\nrun C programs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n>2.  C and C++ forces the developer to solve problems such as memory\\n\\n>management over and over again.\\n\\n\\n\\nCan't say I spend any noticeable amount of time on memory management\\n\\nissues, apart from the fact that I frequently need > 4 GB.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n>It's about design patterns, architecture, high level stuff...\\n\\n\\n\\nIf your problem just requires application of a \\\"design pattern\\\" to solve,\\n\\nthen it's trivial anyway irrespective of language.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n>I am amazed by the amount of time wasted by people talking about low\\n\\n>level problems that have been solved 10 million times over and over\\n\\n>and over again...\\n\\n\\n\\nYou appear to be gratuitously asserting that C programmers waste time\\n\\non irrelevant low-level problems and Java programmers don't.  Depends\\n\\nentirely on the programmer, not the language.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n>3.  Java is not just a programming language! It's also a platform...\\n\\n\\n\\nBuzzword.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n>a monolithic set of API's or a crap load of different API's slicing\\n\\n>and dicing the same problems 50 different ways?\\n\\n\\n\\nUnsupported assertion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n>4.  If you have a program of any type of high complexity written in C, you\\n\\n>can't possibly think that you could port it to different platforms within\\n\\n>the same magnitude of cost as Java....\\n\\n\\n\\nDunno.  E.g., I ported a wee 15000-line C program to Darwin on PowerPC\\n\\nin a few minutes yesterday.  Sure if it was badly designed it would be\\n\\n10 times the size and harder to port.  If it depended on unavailable\\n\\nlibraries it would be much harder.  Portable code is easy to port.\\n\\nAt least that is the case when then language you used is available on\\n\\nthe target platform: I also run on ARM systems with no proper Java.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n>5.  Makes no sense for a scientific or a business project to depend on a\\n\\n>person... Java, IMHO, reduces the dependence of these entities on the\\n\\n>individual developer as it is much easier to reverse engineer Java as it is\\n\\n>to reverse engineer C (large applications).\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can pay a good programmer to solve your problem now, or else get\\n\\nsome kids to hack spaghetti Fortran in any language and then pay for\\n\\nmaintenance headaches ad infinitum.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n>6.  Hardware is getting so fast that I'm not sure if the performance\\n\\n>difference between Java and C/C++ are relevant any more.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhoah!!!  Performance matters to me every day.  (Right now I'm taking\\n\\ntime out to write email while waiting for a job to run).  Sure I could\\n\\nwait 5 years until everyone's PC is fast enough to generate random EC's\\n\\nin no time, when any twit will be able to program inefficient code\\n\\nthat is fast enough and the market will be overrun by competitors,\\n\\nor I can do it now when very few people can.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n>The end goal is the scientific or business problem to be solved.\\n\\n\\n\\nYes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n>And for those problems, languages such as Java, SmallTalk, and others\\n\\n>allow you to think more high level than low level.  Thinking of bits\\n\\n>and bytes takes too much gray matter away from the real important\\n\\n>problems....\\n\\n\\n\\nIt's true!  I admit everything!  Mea maxima culpa!  Working in C makes\\n\\nme spend all day thinking base, rank thoughts about hard-core bitography!\\n\\nNot.\\n\\n\\n\\nActually I spend most of my time thinking in high-level mathematics.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n>Why do most computer scientists insist on solving the same problems\\n\\n>over and over again [...]\\n\\n\\n\\nDunno, and frankly I don't see the relevance to the issue at hand.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI'm sure Java is fine for some stuff, as is C or whatever.

By integrating the advanced\\n\\n  communications capabilities of the WebEx platform with Endeavors' secure P2P\\n\\n  collaboration network, Endeavors has created a new method of world-class\\n\\n  teamwork and interaction without the hassle of travel.\\n\\n\\n\\n  With the rapid growth in popularity of Web meetings, the rationale for this\\n\\n  world-class relationship stems from the growing need for workgroups around\\n\\n  the world to maintain the quality of the team collaboration experience\\n\\n  between online meetings. The issue by those preferring not to travel is how\\n\\n  to continue to collaborate and share information with team members between\\n\\n  meetings rather than depending on intermittent, insecure email and multiple\\n\\n  copies of constantly changing documents.\\n\\n\\n\\n  Inter-meeting collaboration needs an asynchronous medium, independent of\\n\\n  time. In asynchronous mode, a team member can access, read and edit\\n\\n  information relevant to the meeting group at his/her convenience rather than\\n\\n  having to fit into the schedules and timeframes of others. A secured\\n\\n  environment available only to members of a meeting or project is also\\n\\n  essential.\\n\\n\\n\\n  Endeavors' Magi technology converts the Web into a secure platform for\\n\\n  sharing information directly from people's desktops. WebEx meetings can be\\n\\n  recorded and reviewed at any time, documents shared in the meeting can be\\n\\n  actioned in real-time or at a later date, calendars and project schedules\\n\\n  can be updated at any time, and new individuals added to the workgroup at\\n\\n  will . all in a secure environment with people working across the globe,\\n\\n  inside or outside company firewalls.\\n\\n\\n\\n  Magi peer collaboration securely delivers significant benefits to Web\\n\\n  meeting participants. Not only can they share and access information at\\n\\n  will, but they can also know which other participants are online or\\n\\n  \\\"present.\\\" This enables them to chat and message each other, search across\\n\\n  other people's Magi environment, and work jointly on relevant documents\\n\\n  highly productively. With Magi collaboration, in tandem with WebEx\\n\\n  conferencing, the savings can be huge in terms of travel costs, phone bills,\\n\\n  and, most importantly, timely completion of projects and tasks.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\\"In order to realise the full potential of Web meetings, best-of-breed\\n\\n  services are needed to eliminate time and geographical boundaries,\\\" says\\n\\n  Bernard Hulme, Tadpole's group chief executive. \\\"The powerful combination\\n\\n  of Endeavors' Magi and WebEx's communications technologies will assist\\n\\n  global work teams to better meet critical business goals and deadlines by\\n\\n  maintaining teamwork momentum within and between Web meetings.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\\"WebEx is transforming the way businesses use the Web for sales, marketing,\\n\\n  training, support and product design,\\\" says David Farrington, vice president\\n\\n  of corporate development at WebEx Communications. \\\"By integrating the\\n\\n  communications capabilities of the WebEx platform with Endeavors' secure\\n\\n  collaboration network, Endeavors has created an offering that provides the\\n\\n  best in synchronous and asynchronous communications.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n  About Magi\\n\\n  Magi Enterprise 3.0, an award-winning web collaboration system, transforms\\n\\n  today's Web into a highly secure inter- and intra-enterprise collaboration\\n\\n  network of files and web resources.
